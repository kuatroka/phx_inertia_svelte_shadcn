   ðŸŽ® High-Performance Tetris Implementation Plan

Architecture Overview:

 â€¢ Backend: Phoenix controllers with SQLite persistence for game sessions and high scores
 â€¢ Frontend: Svelte 5 + Canvas rendering + Web Workers for maximum performance
 â€¢ Design: Game Boy aesthetic with green monochrome palette and brick borders

Key Performance Features:

 â€¢ Web Worker for game logic (keeps UI thread free)
 â€¢ Canvas rendering with pre-baked sprite sheets
 â€¢ Debounced SQLite persistence (every 5s or on visibility change)
 â€¢ PWA caching for instant offline loading
 â€¢ Manual Vite chunks for optimal loading

Database Schema:

 â€¢ sessions table: user_id, game state (JSON), score, level, lines
 â€¢ high_scores table: user_id, score, level, lines with composite indexes

Implementation Highlights:

 â€¢ Game engine in TypeScript with Int8Array board (10Ã—20 = 200 elements)
 â€¢ RequestAnimationFrame loop with frame diffs via postMessage
 â€¢ Tailwind custom colors for Game Boy palette
 â€¢ IndexedDB for offline resume capability

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this Tetris game based on this plan? I can start with the database migrations and work
through the components systematically.
